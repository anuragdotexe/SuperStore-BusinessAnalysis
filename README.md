# Superstore Sales Data Analysis Project - Business Analysis

## About This Project
This project is all about analyzing sales data from a superstore to find interesting trends and patterns. The goal is to understand which products are selling the most, which regions are the most profitable, and how we can use data to make better business decisions.

## What I Did
- **Cleaned the Data**: Fixed missing values, removed duplicates, and got the dataset ready for analysis.
- **Basic Stats**: Used statistics to get an overview of the sales, profits, and other important factors in the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified any extreme sales values using z-scores and filtered them out to focus on typical sales patterns.
- **Visualizations**: Created graphs and charts to visualize the data—things like sales by region, product category, and more.
- **Key Insights**: Found out which regions, products, and customer segments are the most profitable for the superstore.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Numpy**: For working with numerical data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating various types of plots and graphs.
- **Plotly & Cufflinks**: For interactive charts and exploring data visually.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the code and present the analysis.

## How to Run It
1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/superstore-sales-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Task-5.ipynb
   ```

## What I Found
- The data helped identify top-performing regions and product categories in terms of sales and profit.
- Outliers in the sales data were filtered out to improve the accuracy of insights.
- Insights on how different customer segments and shipping modes affect overall profitability were generated.

## What’s Next
- I’m considering expanding this project by adding some machine learning models to predict future sales.
- I also want to enhance the visualizations to make them even more useful for business analysis.
